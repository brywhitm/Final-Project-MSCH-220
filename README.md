# Final-Project-MSCH-220
This repository contains a game created in MSCH-220. The theme of the game is End of The World.


As the day of the apocalypse nears, the denizens of hell grow in excitement. 
One particular demon is chosen to go into the land of the mortals. Once there, 
they will wreak havoc upon the world and activate the five pentagram totems,
opening the way for the rest of hell and beginning the apocalypse. 
Will humanity be able to stop HELLâ€™S HERALD? Or will they all watch the world burn?

Hell's Herald is a 2-D platformer created as a part of a game jam for MSCH-220 at Indiana University.
